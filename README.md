# vuegram

![CI](https://github.com/SiwyKrzysiek/vuegram/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

My project done by following the [Building a Real-World Web App With Vue.js and Firebase](https://savvyapps.com/blog/definitive-guide-building-web-app-vuejs-firebase) tutorial.
Done mostly as a way to learn how to connect Firebase to Vue project.

Project is [deployed to Firebase Hosting](https://vuegram-kd.web.app).  
Deployment is automatically done by [GH Action](https://github.com/SiwyKrzysiek/vuegram/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml). This is my first attempt at CI :D
